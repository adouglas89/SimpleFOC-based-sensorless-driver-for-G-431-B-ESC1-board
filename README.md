# SimpleFOC-based-sensorless-driver-for-G-431-B-ESC1-board
This is a repository to produce a silent motor driver using the simpleFOC libraries on a B-G431-b-ESC1 board.  It accepts speed commands by PWM, in the standard way for a reversible fan (50% duty is standing still, 100% is full forward 0% is full backwards).  It is reversible direction and will have rapid acceleration capabilities.
